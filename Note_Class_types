Classes in Java:

All Java codes are "Blueprints" to build "objects".

Class types:
1- Driver: contains only method "main()".
2- Abstract data types (ADT) : "Blueprints" to print objects.
3- Utility Classes : Such as "Math" class are used to store constants and utility methods.

An example:
  consider we have 1000 cars with the same manufacturer and same model.
  each car was built based one a single blueprint, therefore they are having the same components.

Result:

      In OOD(object-oriented programming) : 
                                            instance of the class of objects = cars (C1, C2, etc).
                                            ADT Class = blueprint to build objects(cars here!).
